  # # TLDR: If you want to install a Volttron Central Platform agent, you must first install the
  # # Platform Driver before installing VCP agent
  # # Additional: VolttronCentralPlatform requires Bacpypes, which gets installed only when Platform Driver is installed.
  # # This is an unfortunate and not ideal setup, however, this issue will be addresed in a later PR so that VCP Agent
  # # can be installed on its own without having to install Platform Driver first.
